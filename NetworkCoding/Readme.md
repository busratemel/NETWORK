# NETWORK

This paper proposes a new architecture for
wireless networks. In addition to forwarding packets, routers mix
packets from different sources to increase the information
content of each transmission. We show that intelligently mixing
packets increases network throughput. Our design is rooted in
the theory of network coding. XOR method is implemented to
mix incoming packets on the butterfly topology. The project is
written in Python language and compiled in application
PyCharm.
